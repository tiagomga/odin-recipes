    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>6 ounces dark chocolate (70% cacao), chopped into small pieces</li>
        <li>10 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup ground almond meal (also know as almond flour)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon coffee liqueur</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>tiny pinch cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>¾ cup white granulated sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            Generously grease an 8-inch cake pan with butter,
            and place a round piece of parchment paper in the
            bottom. Dust the inside and sides with flour and
            knock out access. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place chocolate and butter in a mixing bowl, and
            place on top of a saucepan filled with 1 inch of
            water. Place on low heat until the butter and
            chocolate have melted.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from heat, and stir together with a spatula.
            Stir in almond meal, cocoa powder, coffee liqueur,
            salt, and cayenne until fully combined. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine eggs and sugar in a second bowl, and beat
            with an electric mixer, or whisk by hand until very
            thick and pale colored.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour chocolate mixture into the egg mixture; fold
            in gently with a spatula until just combined. Transfer
            batter into the prepared pan. Tap pan on the counter
            to settle the mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a wooden skewer
            inserted near the center comes out almost clean,
            25 to 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let cool for 30 minutes in the pan before turning
            out onto a plate. Let cool to room temperature,
            before wrapping and transferring into the fridge
            to chill before serving.
        </li>
        <li>
            Before cutting, the top can be dusted with cocoa
            and/or powdered sugar if desired. Serve with unsweetened
            whipped cream and fresh raspberries.
        </li>
