    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups halved grape tomatoes, well drained</li>
        <li>4 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into 1/4-inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, pressed</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>8 (1/2-inch thick) diagonal slices baguette</li>
        <li>fresh basil leaves for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place tomatoes, mozzarella, sliced basil, garlic,
            1 tablespoon olive oil, and balsamic vinegar in a bowl,
            and fold until well combined. Season to taste with salt
            and pepper. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and
            preheat the oven's broiler. Brush baguette slices with
            remaining olive oil until lightly coated. Arrange in a
            single layer on a baking sheet; season with salt. Broil
            until lightly browned, about 1 minute, being careful not
            to burn.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spoon tomato mixture onto toasted baguette immediately
            before serving, and garnish with fresh basil leaves.
        </li>
    </ol>
